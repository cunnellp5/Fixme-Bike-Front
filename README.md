# Fixme-Bike
An opportunity for bicyclists to collaborate with bicycle stores for repairs on the fly!

### Description:
The idea is, when a bicyclist gets a flat tire or a broken chain, typically you call
someone for a ride back home. How about sending a request to nearby bike stores instead?
they can then send another bicyclist with the gear needed to repair your bike on the road.
