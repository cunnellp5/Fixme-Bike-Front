# Fixme-Bike
An opportunity for bicyclists to collaborate with bicycle stores for repairs on the fly!

### Description:
The idea is, when a bicyclist gets a flat tire or a broken chain, typically you call
someone for a ride back home. How about sending a request to nearby bike stores instead?
they can then send another bicyclist with the gear needed to repair your bike on the road.

#### Future plans:
- Maps like uber does it.
- Implement some paypal system.
- Translate into a mobile first framework, like Quasar.


#### Dev Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
